💊 Web-Based Inventory Management Information System for Macoleen’s Pharmacy

This project is a Web-Based Inventory Management Information System (IMS) developed as a capstone project by students of the Kolehiyo ng Lungsod ng Dasmariñas, aimed at improving the inventory operations of Macoleen’s Pharmacy in Dasmariñas, Cavite.
