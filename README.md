💊 Web-Based Inventory Management Information System for Macoleen’s Pharmacy

This project is a Web-Based Inventory Management Information System (IMS) developed as a capstone project by students of the Kolehiyo ng Lungsod ng Dasmariñas, aimed at improving the inventory operations of Macoleen’s Pharmacy in Dasmariñas, Cavite.

📌 Project Context
Macoleen’s Pharmacy previously managed inventory through a manual, paper-based system, resulting in issues such as stockouts, overstocking, and expired products. To address these challenges, this system was developed to:

Digitize inventory tracking.

Enable real-time monitoring of stock levels.

Generate alerts for low stock and near-expiry items.

Simplify transaction and order processes.

Centralize reporting and analytics.

🎯 Objectives
Replace manual inventory logs with a centralized digital system.

Streamline order request handling between the pharmacy and Noynay Medical Clinic.

Allow staff to generate real-time sales and inventory reports.

Reduce errors and improve customer satisfaction through automation.

🧩 Key Features
🔐 User Management Module – Role-based access for managers, pharmacists, cashiers, and nurses.

📦 Inventory Module – Real-time stock tracking, expiry alerts, product categorization.

📝 Order Request Module – Digital order submissions from medical staff.

📊 Report Management – Sales, stock, and audit reports.

📋 Audit Trail – Monitors all user activity for transparency.

=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
